1. In this workshop I have used three parallel arrays which were:
    
    double cost[MAX_ITEMS] = { 0.0 };
    int priority[MAX_ITEMS] = { 0 };
    char financeOptions[MAX_ITEMS] = { 0 };

   In part-2, to be able to calculate the amount filtered by priorty
   I have used a statement like:

    for (i = 0; i < itemNum; i++)
    {
 	if (priority[i] == priorityFilter)
        {
        	amount += cost[i];
        }

        if (priority[i] == priorityFilter && financeOptions[i] == 'y')
        {
                financeNote = 1;
        }
     }
  
   In this statement the code conducts a search where the key is priority[i], 
   If this key is equal to filter entered by user, it brings up the cost[i] 
   value and accumulate into the amount variable.

2. Iterating arrays starting from 0 is essential since the index value of
   arrays start from 0. That means the computer considers the first element 
   of the array as 0. If we start iterating from 1 the first element of the
   array would be never touched. To illustrate:

    for ( i = 0; i < itemNum; i++)
    {
	if (financeOptions[i] == 'y')
        {
        	financeNote = 1;
        }
    }

   This is a for loop that searches a 'y' character in financeOptions array.
   If we start the for loop from 1, the code never considers if the first 
   element of financeOption, resulting in a semantic error.

3. Arrays are basically trains. Anything that is inside an array lines up
   like a bunch of locomotives. These locomotives are called elements in the
   array. Let's say we need to find a locomotive in this train. First, we need 
   to know its number. The first locomotive in our array train starts from 0, 
   and goes up one by one. So the most basic way to search our locomotive is,
   we can start from locomotive 0 and pass onto other one until we find ours.
   This is called a linear search and computers can do it with a for loop.
