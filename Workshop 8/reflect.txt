1. ReportData structure has 3 int and 6 double members. Which means the minimum memory required would be 12 + 48 = 60 bytes.
   We could increase the memory efficiency of the passing of this structure to a function via passing it by address, instead 
   of passing by value. For the "displayReportData" function, passing by address would look like this:
   
	void displayReportData(const struct ReportData* display, const int cheapOption)
	{
		printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf", display->sku, display->price, display->weightLbs,
			display->weightKg, display->grams, display->calories, display->servings, display->costPerServing, display->caloriesPerServing);
	
		if (cheapOption)
		{
			printf(" ***");
		}
	}
	
	This way, the struct is modified in the function instead of being copied. 
	
2. The ReportData structure could be improved by including a CatFoodInfo type as a member. To illustrate:

	struct ReportData
	{
		struct CatFoodInfo info;
		double weightKg;
		int grams;
		double servings;
		double costPerServing;
		double caloriesPerServing;
	};
	
	In this case, the "displayReportData" function would be as:
	
	void displayReportData(const struct ReportData display, const int cheapOption)
	{
		printf("%07d %10.2lf %10.1lf %10.4lf %9d %8d %8.1lf %7.2lf %7.5lf", display.info.sku, display.info.price, display.info.weight,
			display.weightKg, display.grams, display.info.calories, display.servings, display.costPerServing, display.caloriesPerServing);
	
		if (cheapOption)
		{
			printf(" ***");
		}
	}
